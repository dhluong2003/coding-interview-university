# Algorithm complexity
## Asymptotic notation
- used for comparing 2 algos' complexity as the input size grows to infinity 
- has the form of O(x) where x represents the complexity order (n for linear order, $n^2$ for quadratic, 1 for constant time order, etc.)
- reflects the worst case complexity
    - best case complexity notation: $\omega$(x)
